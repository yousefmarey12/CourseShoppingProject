So you have a recipe service. It contains
- original lists of recipes
- A way to get the copy of the original lists
- A declaration that an event will be emitted. 
Now in recipeItem, we emit the event and the event is "recipe" which we got as an Input from recipe lists
After we emit it, we subscribe in the recipe component and tell SelectedRecipe to be what was emitted.
That's really it.

Shopping list
We want to save the default shopping list items and make them inaccessible from outside. However, we want to use
a copy of the default shopping lists. The method to add to the shopping list will stay in the service, but
we will call the method from outside.
